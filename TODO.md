Lot's of things to do !

Boring bits :
* Refactoring ... really.
* Make a manual, maybe.

Easy bits :
* Implement multiple sorting and grouping methods for planets.
* Add tooltips on planets.
* Make a button to add a new goal in a project.
* Hide some forms with collapsible sections.

Not so easy bits : 
* Change the way to pull systems in the Home to a dynamic one. 
  Need either to add the like operator to macaque or to implement a prefix tree. (First solution is better)
* Add a clean way to put notes on tree nodes and planets. Maybe with bootstrap's popover.
* Add a system to monitor PI cycles.
