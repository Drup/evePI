Lot of things to do !

Boring bits :
* Refactoring ... really.
* Make a manual, maybe.

Easy bits :
* Add messages (like confirmation or fail) on the login/acount creation form.
* Add a planet counter for projects
* Home : 
  * Implement multiple sorting and grouping methods for planets.
  * Add tooltips on planets.
* Project list : 
  * Be able to select multiples goals when creating a project.
* Project :
  * A button to add a new planet to the project.
* Admin :
  * Make a button to add a new goal in a project.
  * Make a button to rename a project.
  * Make a form to add other admins.

Not so easy bits : 
* Change the way to pull systems in the Home to a dynamic one. 
  Need either to add the like operator to macaque or to implement a prefix tree. (First solution is better)
* Add a clean way to put notes on tree nodes and planets. Maybe with bootstrap's popover.
* Add a system to monitor PI cycles.
